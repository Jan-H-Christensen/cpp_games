# Hi, I'm Jan 👋

As a 90s kid, I have a great passion for pixel art and classic video games. In this repository, you'll find my attempts to recreate some of these timeless classics in C++.

## 🎯 My Goal

The main goal of this project is to improve my C++ skills while having fun. I will be developing various games, starting with a Tetris clone.
